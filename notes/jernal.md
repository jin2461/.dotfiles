today was an eepy day
this morning I was tired so I stayed in bed with my phone for 4 hours
I did put on my skirt for a bit and that was incredibly nice
I love my skirt so much
then got up and went to lunch with cousins
it was fine, a bit uncomfortable and draining, but ok, not too bad, I had my music
after I got back I went back to bed and read manga and such, masterbaited, I didnt feel that bad about it
then put on skirt and read a good manga, it was nice, if not a bit nieve and idealistic
still was fun
then had dinner and made music, that was nice
I love my skirt so much, I wish I could wear it all the time, and it makes me sad that I can only wear it in private
I love my friends so much
Ill probably shower tomarrow morning, not feeling like it now

I got reverse shells working today, which was really cool, and am proud of myself
then meetup with friends, bit anxious on the train but all good
moma was a lot of fun, bit tired but enjoyable, very comfy, very nice
food was good, banter was incredibly fun, I felt incredibly safe and comfortable with them
cat cafe was unavalible, which is sad, but its ok
got really anxious and scared and ton of self detrimental thoughts on the way to the clothing store, but was able to talk to friends about it
friends tried to cheer me up, and eventually I was able to try on skirt
IT WAS SO GOOD
I AM SOO HAPPY
I CANT STOP SMILING
GENDER EUFORIA IS INCREDIBLE
AHHHH

this morning was tough, I woke up at 3am, masturbated, felt like absolute shit, and disgusting, and wasted time
then was sad because no snow day, but was able to arrive late to school
day was nice, classes were good, but very tired overall
afternoon was also nice, blahajs are incredible, and it was fun talking with friends
very excited for the trip tomarrow!

today was nice, I felt good, all my classes were nice, I had fun
I have a hypothosys that the reason I am relatively disconnected from my emotions is that I was often overstimulated
in middle school, and without the neccisary tools to deal with it, I resorted to shutting off my physical feelings
and retreeting to my brain
anyway, today was a good day
